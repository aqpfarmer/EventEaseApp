Welcome to the Event Ease Application! This webapp lets you manage and register for events easily. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Events List: View all upcoming events with details and images. You can also Edit the details or delete events.
Register For Event: Click an event to register. Enter your details and select one or more events. Duplicate registrations for the same event/email are prevented.
Add Event: Organizers can add new events with name, date, location, description, and image.
Edit/Delete: Edit or remove events from the Events List page.
Paging: Large event lists are paged for easy navigation.
Session Info: Your session details are shown in the header. This is a way to showcase user session management.
