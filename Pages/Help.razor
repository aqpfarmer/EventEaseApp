</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Events List:</b> View all upcoming events with details and images. You can also Edit the details or delete events.</li>
    <li><b>Register For Event:</b> Click an event to register. Enter your details and select one or more events. Duplicate registrations for the same event/email are prevented.</li>
    <li><b>Add Event:</b> Organizers can add new events with name, date, location, description, and image.</li>
    <li><b>Edit/Delete:</b> Edit or remove events from the Events List page.</li>
    <li><b>Paging:</b> Large event lists are paged for easy navigation.</li>
    <li><b>Session Info:</b> Your session details are shown in the header. This is a way to showcase user session management.</li>
</ul>
